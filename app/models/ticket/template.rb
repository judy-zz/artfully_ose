#TODO: This class is supposed to encapsulate creating a ticket so that whoever is creating the Ticket (section, show, etc..)
# will always have the tickets created properly.  Instead, this class take a hash of whatever the called passed in, so Tickets
# can be created with whatever attrs are passed in.  We want it to be very easy for callers to
# create tickets the exact same way every time.
#
# Do not use this class or method.  Instead, use Ticket.create_many
