  # This is essentially copied from the payment class. There's an issue with how
  # Rails auto-loads models, and finding out what classes have inherited from you.
  #
  # A subclass
  # For example, a subclass called WonkaPayment can call payment_method :wonka
  # Then callers can instantiate a WonkaPayment by calling Payment.create :wonka
  #
  # This will also define an instance method called "payment_method" on the subclass
  # which will return a stringification of the symbol
